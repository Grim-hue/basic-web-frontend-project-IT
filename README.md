# Web Frontend Project

## Overview

This is a basic web frontend project created as part of the **Tecnologias da Internet 1** course at **ISTEC**. The project demonstrates how to build a simple, responsive, and interactive web page using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the project is to create a dynamic webpage with a responsive layout, form validation, and accessibility features.

## Objectives

- **HTML5**: Use semantic HTML tags and proper structure.
- **CSS3**: Implement responsive design using Flexbox and/or Grid Layout, and apply animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Add interactivity by manipulating the DOM, handling form validation, and dynamically updating the page content.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Functional navigation menu.
- Form with validation (name, email, and message fields).
- Dynamic interaction via JavaScript (e.g., showing/hiding elements, updating content).
- Accessible design with proper use of alt attributes for images and ARIA labels where needed.

## Folder Structure

### `images/`
Contains image assets used across the project. Example files include:
- `profile_10.png`, `profile_11.png`, `profile_12.png`, `profile_13.png`, `profile_14.png`, and `profile.png`.
- These images can be used for profile displays or as placeholders in the project.

### `pages/`
Contains the HTML pages of the project. Example files include:
- `aboutus.html`: A page providing information about the project or the team.
- `chat.html` and duplicated/fake chat pages (e.g., `fake_chat1.html`, `fake_chat2.html`, etc.): Pages simulating a chat interface.
- `index.html`: The homepage of the project.
- `login.html`: A login page for user authentication.

### `scripts/`
Contains JavaScript files for dynamic behavior. Example files include:
- `email-send.js`: Likely handles sending emails or form submissions.
- `functional-chat.js` and `functional-post.js`: Provide functionality for chat or post interactions.
- `login.js`: Script for managing login functionality, such as validation.
- `script.js` and `utils.js`: General-purpose scripts for other project features.

### `styles/`
Contains CSS files for styling the pages. Example files include:
- `aboutus.css`: Styling specific to the `aboutus.html` page.
- `chat.css`: Styling for chat-related pages.
- `login.css`: Styling for the login page.
- `style.css`: General styles shared across the project.

### `README.md`
This README file, documenting the purpose, objectives, and structure of the project.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3** for styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content manipulation and form validation.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the homepage.
3. Navigate through the pages using the links provided in the navigation menu.
4. For dynamic features (e.g., chat functionality), ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.

## Future Improvements

- Consolidate duplicate chat pages (`fake_chatX.html`) to make the project more modular.
- Add server-side functionality to make the chat and login pages functional.
- Improve the accessibility of the project by further testing and implementing ARIA roles.
- Enhance the design by adding CSS animations and transitions.
