# Web Frontend Project

## Overview

This is a basic web frontend project created as part of the **Tecnologias da Internet 1** course at **ISTEC**. The project demonstrates how to build a simple, responsive, and interactive web page using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the project is to create a dynamic webpage with a responsive layout, form validation, and accessibility features.

## Objectives

- **HTML5**: Use semantic HTML tags and proper structure.
- **CSS3**: Implement responsive design using Flexbox and/or Grid Layout, and apply animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Add interactivity by manipulating the DOM, handling form validation, and dynamically updating the page content.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Functional navigation menu.
- Form with validation (name, email, and message fields).
- Dynamic interaction via JavaScript (e.g., showing/hiding elements, updating content).
- Accessible design with proper use of alt attributes for images and ARIA labels where needed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3** for styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content manipulation and form validation.
